This project is intended to be a simple, adaptable JavaScript library
for developers who want to create JavaScript-based endpoints for KNS.
These endpoints might be web sites, mobile apps (through frameworks
like PhoneGap or on platforms like webOS), or anything else in which
JavaScript is the main language being used.

At present, it is very simple. Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
